# 3D-CUPP
This will be the best project ever

we also have boxes:
- First task
  - [X] implement a good version of PointNet
  - [X] implement implement the supplementary code ( need to expand)
- second task
  - [X] create code for creating a binary image from PC
  - [ ] create documentation for creating a binary image from PC
  - [ ] add depth to the 2d image 
  - [X] decide and create a filter for the image and decide the scaling
  - [X] create a network that gets M projected images (28x28) create M feature or class vectors\
  then perform a symmetric function over the M dimension and then classify.
  - [ ] Try version with Batch-norm instead of dropout.
  - [X] Try Pic-net with rotation and jitter. Conclusion: Don't rotate for 28x28. 
  - [ ] Try more pixels: 32, 64, etc.
  - [ ] Try more projection angles: pi/4, random, etc.
  - [ ] Try FPS for projection angles (FPP).
  
- Third task 
  - [ ] Implement a full version of PointNet and get to ~89 accuracy
- Forth task 
  - [ ] combining things

- Ideas worth spreading
  - [ ] Take max from the features of pc and proj.
  - [ ] Train the networks separately first (keep features weights) and then join them.

  
- [ ] we also need to order some good pizza.
